Next Generation Learning Platform

##Our Vision
GATHER INSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONAL STUDENT DATA AND SHARE IT FOR ONE SCHOOL

##Our Value Proposition: 
For Next Generation schools 
Who want to provide timely and relevant data reports, 
The NGL Platform is an integrated data store 
That unifies data to give a single shareable view. 
Unlike the monopolistic organizations like Power School and Jupiter, 
Our project follows the Design Principles.

##Definition of Done
For a feature to be called done the following criteria should be met:

 - Code has been peer reviewed
 - No ReSharper warnings
 - Unit test coverage for business logic and repositories
 - Unit test coverage for complex controllers
 - Automated UI tests for every feature 
 - Integration tests added if needed
 - Code must be completely checked in to the source control 
 - The build and all the automated tests should be green
 - UI looks nice and works on different resolutions on major browsers 
 - End user validation and tooltips are done
 - Security permission checks have been implemented
 - Automated database migration scripts are provided
 - Sample data needed to test the feature is scripted, if required
